                    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i> Wayne Rooney</h2>
                    <p>English football's great prodigy when signed from Everton as a teenager in 2004, Rooney's United career saw him win it all and, even as he entered the final stages, he was setting new records. Wayne's goalscoring peak came between 2009 and 2012, as he netted 84 goals across these three campaigns, but he was a reliable scorer across his Old Trafford stint, managing 10 or more in 12 straight campaigns. At the beginning of 2016/17, his last season with the Reds, he was on 245 goals and that Stoke set-piece eventually took him past Sir Bobby's milestone. He finished on 253 - a mark that is sure to stand for a good few years yet.</p>

                    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-2"></i> Bobby Charlton</h2>
                    <p>For many, Charlton is the greatest Red, although both his appearances and goalscoring records have now been overtaken, by Giggs and Rooney respectively. A product of our famed youth system, like Scholes, Hughes, Giggs, Best and Viollet, Sir Bobby survived the Munich Air Disaster and was the key figure in Busby's second great side, which won the league twice and the European Cup between 1965 and 1968. His two strikes in the final win over Benfica are among our most cherished</p>

                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-3"></i> Denis Law</h2>
                <p>One of United's most prolific strikers, Law still holds the record for the quickest-ever Red to 100 goals - it took the Scot just 110 games following his 1962 transfer from Torino. While, perhaps surprisingly, Law never topped the English league scoring charts while at Old Trafford, his amazingly consistent scoring record - 24+ goals in six of his first seven campaigns - means he would probably be way out on his own at the top of this list, had it not been for a series of knee injuries at the beginning of the 1970s.</p>

                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-4"></i> Jack Rowley</h2>
                <p>Jack's younger brother, Arthur, was more prolific in English football, having scored a whopping 434 league goals, but the elder Rowley enjoyed greater longevity at the highest level and was the main goal-getter in Sir Matt Busby's FA Cup and league winning sides of 1948 and 1952 respectively. What's most impressive about Jack's eventual mark of 211 is that the vast majority came after his 28th birthday, with the central forward having lost several of his prime years to the Second World War.</p>

                    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-5"></i> George Best</h2>
                    <p>The Belfast Boy started racking up goals for United while still a teenager and he was only 22 years of age when he reached a century of strikes for the club - still a record. His annus mirabilis in scoring terms came in 1967/68, the season in which the Reds claimed the European Cup, with Best scoring our second in the final. It was his 32nd effort of a remarkable campaign which older Reds still go misty-eyed for.</p>
