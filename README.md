# Design  
## Colour Scheme
  
The main colours used across the website are rgba(218, 41, 28,), white and grey. The choice of red was used as it's the type of red used for manchester united brand i.e jerseys, logos, products, etc. so it  was important to showcase that red on the website. 
   
## Typography  
  
I used Google fonts 'Oswald' and 'Roboto' across the entire website, I felt 'Oswald' was a text that can be easily read and a text that seems to be standard across educational/historical websites. I used google fonts to help me decide on what text to use for the body of my website and that's where I found 'Roboto' which reads well alongside 'Oswald'. I also put Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

## Imagery

The imagery used in the website is important. The large, background hero images across the site are designed to make the user feel like a fan. They include images of the Manchester United stadium, Old Trafford, and of fans in the the stadium allowing the user to feel part of the community of fans.
